## 💡 Inspiration

Many micro and small business owners record daily sales and expenses, but the data often stays unused. This makes it difficult to understand profitability, cash flow, or financial risks.

Fynza was inspired by the need to **simplify financial understanding for non-accountants** by turning basic records into clear, visual, and actionable insights.

## 🧩 What Fynza Does

* Secure user authentication (Login & Register)
* Manual entry of income and expense transactions
* Dashboard showing:

  * Total balance
  * Monthly income
  * Monthly expenses
  * Recent transactions
* Clean, simple, and intuitive UI for fast understanding

> In this demo version, data entry is manual and stored on the client side for demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

Fynza was built using a **frontend-first approach** with a clean and modular structure:

* **React** – UI and component-based architecture
* **React Router** – Page routing and navigation
* **Tailwind CSS** – Styling and responsive design
* **Context API** – Authentication and shared state
* **Vite** – Fast development and build tooling

The architecture is designed to be easily extendable to a real backend (Firebase / REST API) in future iterations.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* React
* JavaScript
* Tailwind CSS
* React Router DOM
* Vite
* GitHub Codespaces (development & hosting)

---

## 🧠 How the App Works (Demo Logic)

1. User registers or logs in
2. User is redirected to the dashboard
3. Transactions are added manually via the "Add Transaction" flow
4. Dashboard automatically updates totals and recent transactions

> This approach helps clearly demonstrate the **concept, UX flow, and value proposition** during the hackathon demo.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* No persistent backend storage (demo-only)
* Data resets on refresh
* Authentication is simulated for demonstration

These limitations are intentional to focus on **clarity, usability, and concept validation** within the hackathon timeframe.

---

##  What We Learned

* The importance of user-centered design in fintech tools
* How to simplify complex financial concepts into usable interfaces
* Rapid prototyping and iteration under tight deadlines

---
